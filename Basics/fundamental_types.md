## 2 Important Notes

### 1. Char Type:  
   - **`char`‰∏ç‰øùËØÅ**ÊòØÊúâÁ¨¶Âè∑‰∫¶ÊàñÊó†Á¨¶Âè∑Ôºå Â¶ÇÊûúÊÉ≥‰ΩøÁî®Á≤æÁ°ÆÁöÑÊúâÁ¨¶Âè∑Á±ªÂûãÔºåÈúÄÊòæÁ§∫ÊåáÊòé **`signed char`**.
   
### 2. Signed Integer Overflow:  
   - It's Undefined Behavior (**UB**) for **signed** integers to overflow.  
     > ***Example:***
     `127 + 1` for an 8-bit signed integer is UB.
   
### 3. Unsigned Integer Behavior:  
   - **Unsigned integer** is always `>= 0`.  
     Therefore, loops like `for (unsigned int a = xx; a >= 0; a--)` will result in an infinite loop!  
     - Example: `std::string::find` will return `std::string::npos`, which is typically used like `!= std::string::npos`.
     
   - Since **C++20**, functions like `std::cmp_xxx` defined in `<utility>` can safely compare **unsigned and signed integers (excluding bool/characters)**  
     > ***Examples:***
     > - `std::cmp_greater_equal(std::string::npos, 0)`
     > - `std::in_range<T>(x)` can also be used to check whether a value is representable by integer type `T`.
   
### 4. Division by Zero:  
   - It's **UB** for integers to divide by zero.
   
### 5. Integer Promotion:  
   - All **arithmetic operations** will promote integers that are **smaller than `int`** to **`int`** first.  
     ***That means:***
     `(unsigned) char/short` will be converted to `int` first, and then arithmetic operations will be done. Or `unsigned int` if `int` cannot represent them, in case `sizeof(short) == sizeof(int)`.
     
### 6. Fixed Width Integers:  
   - In `<cstdint>`, there are some fixed-width integers:
     - `std::int(x)_t`, `std::uint(x)_t` where `x = 8/16/32/64`.
     
   - If you want to write very general code, you can use:
     - `std::(u)int_least(x)_t`, where `x = 8/16/32/64`, meaning the integer type has the smallest size that is bigger than `x` bits.  
        > ***Example:***
        If a system supports 16/64 bits, `int_least8_t` has 16 bits.
     - `std::(u)int_fast(x)_t`, where `x = 8/16/32/64`, meaning the integer type is the one that works fastest in the architecture and is bigger than `x` bits.
     - `std::(u)intmax_t`, the biggest integer supported by the system.  
  - **Note**:  
     - In most cases, `std::uint8_t` is `unsigned char`. If you try to output the **address** of `std::uint8_t`, it will attempt to output a **C-string** (i.e., output content until null-termination), which is often unexpected.
     - You need to convert `std::uint8_t*` to `void*` to get the address.

## 3 Bit Manipulation of Integers

In **C++20**, **`<bit>`** is provided to do this
**Note**
All functions in <bit> are for unsigned integers; 
if you want to use in **signed** ones, you need to convert them to **unsigned** ones.


### 1. About the power of 2: 

  - `std::has_single_bit` : check whether an integer has **only a single 1** in bits.
  - `std::bit_ceil` : get the **smallest** integer that is power of two and **not less** than the given value.**(‰∫åËøõÂà∂Âêë‰∏äÂèñÊï¥)**
    - if an integer `has_single_bit`, do nothing; else set the next bit of the highest 1 and clear all other bits.
    - If the highest bit has been set(i.e. result is not representable), UB.
    - The width can be got by `std::bit_width`, which returns `1 + log2ùë•` .
  - `std::bit_floor` : get the biggest integer that is power of two and not greater than the given value.**(‰∫åËøõÂà∂Âêë‰∏ãÂèñÊï¥)**

### 2. For bit rotation:

negative shift is also accepted

- `std::rotl(x, int shiftBits)`: left rotate **(Â∑¶Êóã)**
  > e.g. shift 2 bits: 00011101->01110100
- `std::rotr(x, int shiftBits)`: right rotate **(Âè≥Êóã)**
  > e.g. shift 3 bits: 00011101->10100011
